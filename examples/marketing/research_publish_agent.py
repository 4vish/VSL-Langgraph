"""Sample agent: a research-to-publish pipeline with five real LLM tasks
across three providers, gated by vsl-core through vsl-langgraph.

    Task                      Provider   Model                       VSL role
    ------------------------- ---------- --------------------------- --------------------------------
    1. research                Gemini    gemini-3.5-flash            plain node (no gate needed --
                                                                       gathering info has no side effect)
    2. draft                   OpenAI    gpt-5.6-sol                 plain node (same reason)
    3. fact-check the draft    Claude    claude-opus-4-8             Invariant.rule -- non-bypassable
    4. compliance/tone review  Claude    claude-sonnet-5             PreNode.monitor -- soft threshold
    5. write final published   Claude    claude-haiku-4-5-20251001   the guarded action itself; only
       text                                                          runs if both gates above passed

This is deliberately the same PreNode + Invariant chaining pattern as
examples/purchase_approval_agent.py -- the point of putting three unrelated
provider SDKs (OpenAI's Responses API, Gemini's generate_content, Anthropic's
Messages API) behind it is to make it obvious that vsl-core's gates don't
care what produced the signal they're checking. A monitor or an Invariant
rule is just an async callable returning a GammaEstimate or a bool --
here that callable happens to make a real API call to a different company
each time, and the gate wiring (compile_pre_node/compile_invariant,
gated_node, route_on_denial) doesn't change at all from the synthetic
version. That's the thing LangGraph alone doesn't give you: LangGraph
doesn't know or care about Gamma thresholds, Invariants, or F1
pre-commitment -- vsl-core defines that vocabulary once, and
vsl-langgraph is only the (small) glue making it callable from a node.

With OPENAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY all set, this
makes real calls against a topic you supply:

    python examples/research_publish_agent.py "your topic here"

Without all three keys set, it automatically falls back to
fake_providers.py's deterministic stand-ins and runs all three governance
outcomes (approved / blocked-by-fact-check / blocked-by-compliance)
against canned data instead -- no keys, no cost, no SDKs required, so the
gate-wiring logic is still fully readable and runnable on a bare checkout:

    python examples/research_publish_agent.py
