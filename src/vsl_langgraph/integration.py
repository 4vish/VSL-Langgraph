"""Wiring helpers for calling a compiled VSL gate from inside a LangGraph
node and routing around a denial with `add_conditional_edges`.

vsl-core does not intercept anything on its own (see
vsl-core/docs/building-with-vsl-core.md, "know what's automatic and what
you write yourself"): a compiled gate only ever raises or returns, on
demand, when called. `gated_node` is that call site, made reusable for a
LangGraph StateGraph -- it calls the gate immediately before the wrapped
node would run (preserving F1 pre-commitment: the gate completes strictly
before the guarded node's side effect), and on denial returns a state
update instead of letting the exception propagate, so a conditional edge
can route to a blocked/terminal node in the normal LangGraph way rather
than crashing the graph run.
